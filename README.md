# PenguineCRM

# History
This is an open-source CRM I wrote many years ago and thought I lost when my drive and backup died. I came across an old drive of backups, and to my surprise...look what I found, along with a bunch of unrelated goodies. So many years later let me introduce PenguineCRM :)

# What is PenguineCRM ? It's CRM Math
What is CRM Math? We will look at examples in the CRM Math Section.
But before we start need to understand a few Principles.

# Principles
A Person and a Person are People<br/>
People = Person + Person
Note: People + People would make a "larger" People
People = People + People
People = People + Person

A Group can be a number of People or Person(s)
Group = People //(but People can not equal Group)
Group = People + People
Group = People + Person
Group = People + Person + Person + People
Group = Group + People + Person
