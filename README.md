# Infoledger

# History
This is an open-source CRM I wrote many years ago and thought I lost when my drive and backup died. I came across an old drive of backups, and to my surprise...look what I found, along with a bunch of unrelated goodies. So many years later let me introduce Infoledger :)

# What is Infoledger ? It's CRM Math
What is CRM Math? We will look at examples in the CRM Math Section.<br/>
But before we start we need to understand a few Principles.<br/>

# Principles
A Person and a Person are People<br/>
People = Person + Person<br/>
Note: People + People would make a "larger" People<br/>
People = People + People<br/>
People = People + Person<br/>

A Group can be a number of People or Person(s)<br/>
Group = People //(but People can not equal Group)<br/>
Group = People + People<br/>
Group = People + Person<br/>
Group = People + Person + Person + People<br/>
Group = Group + People + Person<br/>
